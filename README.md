Vem Documentation
=================

This repository contains the source files that are used to generate Vem's
documentation site.

Vem is an alternative command layout for the Vim text editor. It provides full
keyboard control over the editor while trying to be as simple and intuitive as
possible:

* [Vem main site](https://www.vem-editor.org)
* [Vem repository](https://github.com/pacha/vem)

The documentation is written as a
[Spekulatio](https://github.com/pacha/spekulatio) project, using the
[k28b template theme](https://github.com/pacha/k28b).
