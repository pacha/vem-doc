==========

Vem sets sensible configuration options by default. However, there are some
values that you may need to configure to adapt them to your development
environment:

`Keyboard layout </config/essentials/keyboard-layout.html>`__
    Vem supports ``QWERTY``, ``QWERTZ`` and ``AZERTY`` keyboard layouts. Check
    this section if you use use one keyboard that is not ``QUERTY`` (the default
    value).

`Indentation </config/essentials/indentation.html>`__
    By default, Vem uses 4 ``spaces`` for indentation. To use ``tabs`` or change
    the indentation size check this section.

`Line endings </config/essentials/line-endings.html>`__
    In general, the editor is able to detect which correct line ending to use
    (``LF`` or ``CRLF``) depending on the platform it is being executed on or
    the existing newlines in the file that is open. However, if you want to know
    more or force an specific line ending type, check this section.

`Encoding </config/essentials/encoding.html>`__
    Vem uses ``UTF-8`` by default and tries to detect and use other encodings
    depending on the file that is open. If you want to have a different default
    encoding or want to convert existing files, check this section.

`Git integration </config/essentials/git-integration.html>`__
    Check this section to know how to display the current Git repository branch
    name in Vem's status line.

`Configuration per filetype </config/essentials/configuration-per-filetype.html>`__
    You may want to set some configuration options only for specific file types.
    For instance, you may want to set a different indentation size for CSS or
    YAML files than the one in your programming language. To learn how to do so,
    check this section.
