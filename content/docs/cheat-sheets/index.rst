Cheat Sheets
============

For quick reference, you can access the cheat sheets for each keyboard layout.
There are two versions of each cheat sheet, a basic one with only the most
important commands —very useful if you're starting with Vem—, and a full one
with the complete list:

.. container:: note

    * ``QWERTY``: `Basic </docs/cheat-sheets/qwerty-basic.html>`__ | `Full </docs/cheat-sheets/qwerty-full.html>`__
    * ``QWERTZ``: `Basic </docs/cheat-sheets/qwertz-basic.html>`__ | `Full </docs/cheat-sheets/qwertz-full.html>`__
    * ``AZERTY``: `Basic </docs/cheat-sheets/azerty-basic.html>`__ | `Full </docs/cheat-sheets/azerty-full.html>`__

.. admonition:: Keyboard layouts

    Vem's commands are distributed spatially across the keyboard, which means
    that command positions change depending on the keyboard layout that you use.
    Vem supports the ``QWERTY``, ``QWERTZ`` and ``AZERTY`` layouts. By default,
    ``QWERTY`` is used. If you have a different layout, configure it by
    following the instructions at the `Keyboard layout
    </config/essentials/keyboard-layout.html>`__ section of the documentation.

    To get a quick comparison on how these keyboard layouts differ from one
    another check the `Layout comparison
    </docs/cheat-sheets/layout-comparison.html>`__ page.
